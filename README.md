<h3>Codewars challenges</h3>
<p>
I spend a lot of my free time on Codewars, a collective effort by its users. Here coders are confronted with programming tasksâ€”not unlike the homework assignments of a typical computer science class. Each programming task is in reference to a Japanese martial art called Kata. I'm currently ranked in the 97th percentile (top 3%) of all users.
